# Simply-Cms
### A minb fork into simply-cms because a fast n light cms is all good.
Original open-source code downloaded from the interweb. Thanks to betso for all his creative know-how and jedi-knight php skills.
There is no license in the original source .B2z and hence has no warranty or guarantee as stated in the new MIT LICENSE.
If you have any questions please contact me here at github. 

### Not your average one page cms of wonders
Even with its simple looking interface and layout the code is quite sophisticated by nature.
A real treat to learn as you go and thats exactly what I did. Will post my current builds of the open code with github.
After a few bumps and snaggs I got the script to load true and fast, pushing it through my ssl on a production site.

### Bread and Butter
Some Highlights Included but not limited to:

1. Support for multiple users
2. Create Edit Content with ease
3. Built in Comments with edit functions
3. Clean SEO friendly URLs
5. User friendly administration backend
6. A wysiwyg can be added
7. Simple 1 Page install
8. Support for multi languages

### Security
Found and updated old php header code. All core edits I made will be available soon.
The script includes a ping service to blast your posts to Ping-O-Matic and this can be turned off in the admin area.
New pingo code will be added soon.
No other issues that i can see but if you notice something feel free to pull and report. 

**Will be a treat to edit content source then build apps.**
My first will be the docmumentation of the core build then onto Bigger Projects.. Cheers
