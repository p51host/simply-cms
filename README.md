Thanks to betso for all his creative know-how and jedi-knight php skills..

### Not your avarage one page cms wonders
Despite its simple looking interfaces and layout the code is quite sophisticated by nature.
A real treat to learn as I go and thats exactly what I did. I will post my current builds here.
After a few bumps and snaggs I got the script to load true and fast, pushing it through my ssl on a production site.

#Bread and Butter
1. Some Highlight Include:
2. Support for multiple users
3. Create Edit Content with ease
4. Built in Comments with edit functions
5. Clean SEO friendly URLs
6. User friendly administration backend
7. A wysiwyg can be added

**Will be easy to edit content source then build apps.**
